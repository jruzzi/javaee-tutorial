<h2 id="what-is-a-session-bean">32.2 What Is a Session Bean?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A session bean encapsulates business logic that can be invoked
programmatically by a client over local, remote, or web service client
views. To access an application that is deployed on the server, the
client invokes the session bean&#8217;s methods. The session bean performs
work for its client, shielding it from complexity by executing business
tasks inside the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A session bean is not persistent. (That is, its data is not saved to a
database.)</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Session beans are of three types: stateful, stateless, and singleton.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following topics are addressed here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="stateful-session-beans">32.2.1.1 Stateful Session Beans</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The state of an object consists of the values of its instance variables.
In a stateful session bean, the instance variables represent the state
of a unique client/bean session. Because the client interacts ("talks")
with its bean, this state is often called the conversational state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As its name suggests, a session bean is similar to an interactive
session. A session bean is not shared; it can have only one client, in
the same way that an interactive session can have only one user. When
the client terminates, its session bean appears to terminate and is no
longer associated with the client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The state is retained for the duration of the client/bean session. If
the client removes the bean, the session ends and the state disappears.
This transient nature of the state is not a problem, however, because
when the conversation between the client and the bean ends, there is no
need to retain the state.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="stateless-session-beans">32.2.1.2 Stateless Session Beans</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A stateless session bean does not maintain a conversational state with
the client. When a client invokes the methods of a stateless bean, the
bean&#8217;s instance variables may contain a state specific to that client
but only for the duration of the invocation. When the method is
finished, the client-specific state should not be retained. Clients may,
however, change the state of instance variables in pooled stateless
beans, and this state is held over to the next invocation of the pooled
stateless bean. Except during method invocation, all instances of a
stateless bean are equivalent, allowing the EJB container to assign an
instance to any client. That is, the state of a stateless session bean
should apply across all clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because they can support multiple clients, stateless session beans can
offer better scalability for applications that require large numbers of
clients. Typically, an application requires fewer stateless session
beans than stateful session beans to support the same number of clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A stateless session bean can implement a web service, but a stateful
session bean cannot.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="singleton-session-beans">32.2.1.3 Singleton Session Beans</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A singleton session bean is instantiated once per application and exists
for the lifecycle of the application. Singleton session beans are
designed for circumstances in which a single enterprise bean instance is
shared across and concurrently accessed by clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Singleton session beans offer similar functionality to stateless session
beans but differ from them in that there is only one singleton session
bean per application, as opposed to a pool of stateless session beans,
any of which may respond to a client request. Like stateless session
beans, singleton session beans can implement web service endpoints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Singleton session beans maintain their state between client invocations
but are not required to maintain their state across server crashes or
shutdowns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications that use a singleton session bean may specify that the
singleton should be instantiated upon application startup, which allows
the singleton to perform initialization tasks for the application. The
singleton may perform cleanup tasks on application shutdown as well,
because the singleton will operate throughout the lifecycle of the
application.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="when-to-use-session-beans">32.2.2 When to Use Session Beans</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stateful session beans are appropriate if any of the following
conditions are true.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bean&#8217;s state represents the interaction between the bean and a
specific client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bean needs to hold information about the client across method
invocations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bean mediates between the client and the other components of the
application, presenting a simplified view to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behind the scenes, the bean manages the work flow of several
enterprise beans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To improve performance, you might choose a stateless session bean if it
has any of these traits.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bean&#8217;s state has no data for a specific client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a single method invocation, the bean performs a generic task for
all clients. For example, you might use a stateless session bean to send
an email that confirms an online order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bean implements a web service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Singleton session beans are appropriate in the following circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>State needs to be shared across the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single enterprise bean needs to be accessed by multiple threads
concurrently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application needs an enterprise bean to perform tasks upon
application startup and shutdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bean implements a web service.</p>
