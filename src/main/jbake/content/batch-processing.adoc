55 Batch Processing
-------------------


This chapter describes Batch Applications for the Java Platform (JSR
352), which provides support for defining, implementing, and running
batch jobs. Batch jobs are tasks that can be executed without user
interaction. The batch framework is composed of a job specification
language based on XML, a Java API, and a batch runtime.

The following topics are addressed here:
