55.6 Submitting Jobs to the Batch Runtime
-----------------------------------------

The `JobOperator` interface in the `javax.batch.operations` package
enables you to submit jobs to the batch runtime and obtain information
about existing jobs. This interface provides the following
functionality.

* Obtain the names of all known jobs.
* Start, stop, restart, and abandon jobs.
* Obtain job instances and job executions.

The `BatchRuntime` class in the `javax.batch.runtime` package provides
the `getJobOperator` factory method to obtain `JobOperator` objects.

55.6.1 Starting a Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example code demonstrates how to obtain a `JobOperator`
object and submit a batch job:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
JobOperator jobOperator = BatchRuntime.getJobOperator();
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("parameter1", "value1");
...
long execID = jobOperator.start("simplejob", props);
----

The first argument of the `JobOperator.start` method is the name of the
job as specified in its job definition file. The second parameter is a
`Properties` object that represents the parameters for this job
execution. You can use job parameters to pass to a job information that
is only known at runtime.

55.6.2 Checking the Status of a Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `JobExecution` interface in the `javax.batch.runtime` package
provides methods to obtain information about submitted jobs. This
interface provides the following functionality.

* Obtain the batch and exit status of a job execution.
* Obtain the time the execution was started, updated, or ended.
* Obtain the job name.
* Obtain the execution ID.

The following example code demonstrates how to obtain the batch status
of a job using its execution ID:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
JobExecution jobExec = jobOperator.getJobExecution(execID);
String status = jobExec.getBatchStatus().toString();
----

55.6.3 Invoking the Batch Runtime in Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The component from which you invoke the batch runtime depends on the
architecture of your particular application. For example, you can invoke
the batch runtime from an enterprise bean, a servlet, a managed bean,
and so on.

See link:batch-processing008.html#BCGJHEHJ[The webserverlog Example
Application] and link:batch-processing009.html#BCGFCACD[The phonebilling
Example Application] for details on how to invoke the batch runtime from
a managed bean driven by a JavaServer Faces user interface.
