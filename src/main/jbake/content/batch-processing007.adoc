55.7 Packaging Batch Applications
---------------------------------

Job definition files and batch artifacts do not require separate
packaging and can be included in any Java EE application.

Package the batch artifact classes with the rest of the classes of your
application, and include the job definition files in one of the
following directories:

* `META-INF/batch-jobs/` for `jar` packages
* `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/batch-jobs/` for `war` packages

The name of each job definition file must match its job ID. For example,
if you define a job as follows, and you are packaging your application
as a WAR file, include the job definition file in
`WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/batch-jobs/simplejob.xml`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<job id="simplejob" xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" 
                    version="1.0">
  ...
</job>
----
