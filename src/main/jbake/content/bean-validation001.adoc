21.1 Overview of Bean Validation
--------------------------------

Validating input received from the user to maintain data integrity is an
important part of application logic. Validation of data can take place
at different layers in even the simplest of applications, as shown in
link:jsf-facelets003.html#GIPOB[Developing a Simple Facelets Application:
The guessnumber-jsf Example Application]. The `guessnumber-jsf` example
application validates the user input (in the `h:inputText` tag) for
numerical data at the presentation layer and for a valid range of
numbers at the business layer.

The Java API for JavaBean Validation ("Bean Validation") provides a
facility for validating objects, object members, methods, and
constructors. In Java EE environments, Bean Validation integrates with
Java EE containers and services to allow developers to easily define and
enforce validation constraints. Bean Validation is available as part of
the Java EE 7 platform.
