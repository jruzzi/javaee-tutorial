21.3 Validating Null and Empty Strings
--------------------------------------

The Java programming language distinguishes between null and empty
strings. An empty string is a string instance of zero length, whereas a
null string has no value at all.

An empty string is represented as `""`. It is a character sequence of
zero characters. A null string is represented by `null`. It can be
described as the absence of a string instance.

Managed bean elements represented as a JavaServer Faces text component
such as `inputText` are initialized with the value of the empty string
by the JavaServer Faces implementation. Validating these strings can be
an issue when user input for such fields is not required. Consider the
following example, in which the string `testString` is a bean variable
that will be set using input entered by the user. In this case, the user
input for the field is not required.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
if (testString==null) {
    doSomething();
} else {
    doAnotherThing();
}
----

By default, the `doAnotherThing` method is called even when the user
enters no data, because the `testString` element has been initialized
with the value of an empty string.

In order for the Bean Validation model to work as intended, you must set
the context parameter
`javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL` to `true`
in the web deployment descriptor file, `web.xml`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>
        javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL
    </param-name>
    <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>
----

This parameter enables the JavaServer Faces implementation to treat
empty strings as null.

Suppose, on the other hand, that you have a `@NotNull` constraint on an
element, meaning that input is required. In this case, an empty string
will pass this validation constraint. However, if you set the context
parameter `javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL`
to `true`, the value of the managed bean attribute is passed to the Bean
Validation runtime as a null value, causing the `@NotNull` constraint to
fail.
