25.1 Packaging CDI Applications
-------------------------------

When you deploy a Java EE application, CDI looks for beans inside bean
archives. A bean archive is any module that contains beans that the CDI
runtime can manage and inject. There are two kinds of bean archives:
explicit bean archives and implicit bean archives.

An explicit bean archive is an archive that contains a `beans.xml`
deployment descriptor, which can be an empty file, contain no version
number, or contain the version number 1.1 with the `bean-discovery-mode`
attribute set to `all`. For example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee 
                           http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/beans_1_1.xsd"
       version="1.1" bean-discovery-mode="all">
    ...
</beans>
----

CDI can manage and inject any bean in an explicit archive, except those
annotated with `@Vetoed`.

An implicit bean archive is an archive that contains some beans
annotated with a scope type, contains no `beans.xml` deployment
descriptor, or contains a `beans.xml` deployment descriptor with the
`bean-discovery-mode` attribute set to `annotated`.

In an implicit archive, CDI can only manage and inject beans annotated
with a scope type.

For a web application, the `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, if
present, must be in the `WEB-INF` directory. For EJB modules or JAR
files, the `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, if present, must be in the
`META-INF` directory.
