25.8 Using Stereotypes in CDI Applications
------------------------------------------

A stereotype is a kind of annotation, applied to a bean, that
incorporates other annotations. Stereotypes can be particularly useful
in large applications in which you have a number of beans that perform
similar functions. A stereotype is a kind of annotation that specifies
the following:

* A default scope
* Zero or more interceptor bindings
* Optionally, a `@Named` annotation, guaranteeing default EL naming
* Optionally, an `@Alternative` annotation, specifying that all beans
with this stereotype are alternatives

A bean annotated with a particular stereotype will always use the
specified annotations, so you do not have to apply the same annotations
to many beans.

For example, you might create a stereotype named `Action`, using the
`javax.enterprise.inject.Stereotype` annotation:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@RequestScoped
@Secure
@Transactional
@Named
@Stereotype
@Target(TYPE)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Action {}
----

All beans annotated `@Action` will have request scope, use default EL
naming, and have the interceptor bindings `@Transactional` and
`@Secure`.

You could also create a stereotype named `Mock`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Alternative
@Stereotype
@Target(TYPE)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Mock {}
----

All beans with this annotation are alternatives.

It is possible to apply multiple stereotypes to the same bean, so you
can annotate a bean as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Action
@Mock
public class MockLoginAction extends LoginAction { ... }
----

It is also possible to override the scope specified by a stereotype,
simply by specifying a different scope for the bean. The following
declaration gives the `MockLoginAction` bean session scope instead of
request scope:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@SessionScoped
@Action
@Mock
public class MockLoginAction extends LoginAction { ... }
----

CDI makes available a built-in stereotype called `Model`, which is
intended for use with beans that define the model layer of a
model-view-controller application architecture. This stereotype
specifies that a bean is both `@Named` and `@RequestScoped`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Named
@RequestScoped
@Stereotype
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Model {}
----
