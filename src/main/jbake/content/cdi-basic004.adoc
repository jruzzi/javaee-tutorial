23.4 About CDI Managed Beans
----------------------------

A managed bean is implemented by a Java class, which is called its bean
class. A top-level Java class is a managed bean if it is defined to be a
managed bean by any other Java EE technology specification, such as the
JavaServer Faces technology specification, or if it meets all the
following conditions.

* It is not a nonstatic inner class.
* It is a concrete class or is annotated `@Decorator`.
* It is not annotated with an EJB component-defining annotation or
declared as an EJB bean class in `ejb-jar.xml`.
* It has an appropriate constructor. That is, one of the following is
the case.

** The class has a constructor with no parameters.

** The class declares a constructor annotated `@Inject`.

No special declaration, such as an annotation, is required to define a
managed bean.
