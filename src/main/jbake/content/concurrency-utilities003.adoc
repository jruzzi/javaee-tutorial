56.3 Concurrency and Transactions
---------------------------------

The most basic operations for transactions are commit and rollback, but,
in a distributed environment with concurrent processing, it can be
difficult to guarantee that commit or rollback operations will be
successfully processed, and the transaction can be spread among
different threads, CPU cores, physical machines, and networks.

Ensuring that a rollback operation will successfully execute in such a
scenario is crucial. Concurrency Utilities relies on the Java
Transaction API (JTA) to implement and support transactions on its
components through `javax.transaction.UserTransaction`, allowing
application developers to explicitly manage transaction boundaries. More
information is available in the JTA specification.

Optionally, context objects can begin, commit, or roll back
transactions, but these objects cannot enlist in parent component
transactions.

The following code snippet illustrates a `Runnable` task that obtains a
`UserTransaction` and then starts and commits a transaction while
interacting with other transactional components, such as an enterprise
bean and a database:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
public class MyTransactionalTask implements Runnable {
 
   UserTransaction ut = ... // obtained through JNDI or injection
 
   public void run() {
 
       // Start a transaction
       ut.begin();
 
       // Invoke a Service or an EJB
       myEJB.businessMethod();
 
       // Update a database entity using an XA JDBC driver
       myEJB.updateCustomer(customer);
 
       // Commit the transaction
       ut.commit();
 
   }
}
