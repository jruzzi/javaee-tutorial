56.6 The taskcreator Concurrency Example
----------------------------------------

The `taskcreator` example demonstrates how to use Concurrency Utilities
for Java EE to run tasks immediately, periodically, or after a fixed
delay. This example provides a JavaServer Faces interface that enables
users to submit tasks to be executed and displays information messages
for each task. The example uses the Managed Executor Service to run
tasks immediately and the Managed Scheduled Executor Service to run
tasks periodically or after a fixed delay. (See
link:concurrency-utilities002.html#CIHFBCFH[Main Components of the
Concurrency Utilities] for information about these services.)

The `taskcreator` example consists of the following components.

* A JavaServer Faces page (`index.xhtml`) that contains three elements:
a form to submit tasks, a task execution log, and a form to cancel
periodic tasks. This page submits Ajax requests to create and cancel
tasks. This page also receives WebSocket messages, using JavaScript code
to update the task execution log.
* A CDI managed bean (`TaskCreatorBean`) that processes the requests
from the JavaServer Faces page. This bean invokes the methods in
`TaskEJB` to submit new tasks and to cancel periodic tasks.
* An enterprise bean (`TaskEJB`) that obtains executor service instances
using resource injection and submits tasks for execution. This bean is
also a JAX-RS web service endpoint. The tasks send information messages
to this endpoint.
* A WebSocket endpoint (`InfoEndpoint`) that the enterprise bean uses to
send information messages to the clients.
* A task class (`Task`) that implements the `Runnable` interface. The
`run` method in this class sends information messages to the web service
endpoint in `TaskEJB` and sleeps for 1.5 seconds.

link:#CIHHACFF[Figure 56-1] shows the architecture of the `taskcreator`
example.

 +

The `TaskEJB` class obtains the default executor service objects from
the application server as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService")
ManagedExecutorService mExecService;

@Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultManagedScheduledExecutorService")
ManagedScheduledExecutorService sExecService;
----

The `submitTask` method in `TaskEJB` uses these objects to submit tasks
for execution as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
public void submitTask(Task task, String type) {
    /* Use the managed executor objects from the app server */
    switch (type) {
        case "IMMEDIATE":
            mExecService.submit(task);
            break;
        case "DELAYED":
            sExecService.schedule(task, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            break;
        case "PERIODIC":
            ScheduledFuture<?> fut;
            fut = sExecService.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 0, 8, 
                    TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            periodicTasks.put(task.getName(), fut);
            break;
    }
}
----

For periodic tasks, `TaskEJB` keeps a reference to the `ScheduledFuture`
object, so that the user can cancel the task at any time.

1.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see
link:usingexamples002.html#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish
Server]).
2.  From the File menu, choose Open Project.
3.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
tut-install/examples/concurrency
----
4.  Select the `taskcreator` folder.
5.  Click Open Project.
6.  In the Projects tab, right-click the `taskcreator` project and
select Build.
+
This command builds and deploys the application.

56.6.1.3 To Run the taskcreator Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Open the following URL in a web browser:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://localhost:8080/taskcreator/
----
+
The page contains a form to submit tasks, a task execution log, and a
form to cancel periodic tasks.
2.  Select the Immediate task type, enter a task name, and click the
Submit button. Messages like the following appear in the task execution
log:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
12:40:47 - IMMEDIATE Task TaskA finished
12:40:45 - IMMEDIATE Task TaskA started
----
3.  Select the Delayed (3 sec) task type, enter a task name, and click
the Submit button. Messages like the following appear in the task
execution log:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
12:43:26 - DELAYED Task TaskB finished
12:43:25 - DELAYED Task TaskB started
12:43:22 - DELAYED Task TaskB submitted
----
4.  Select the Periodic (8 sec) task type, enter a task name, and click
the Submit button. Messages like the following appear in the task
execution log:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
12:45:25 - PERIODIC Task TaskC finished run #2
12:45:23 - PERIODIC Task TaskC started run #2
12:45:17 - PERIODIC Task TaskC finished run #1
12:45:15 - PERIODIC Task TaskC started run #1
----
+
You can add more than one periodic task. To cancel a periodic task,
select it from the form and click Cancel Task.
