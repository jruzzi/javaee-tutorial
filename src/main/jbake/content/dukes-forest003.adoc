59.3.1 To Build and Deploy the Duke's Forest Application Using NetBeansIDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see
link:usingexamples002.html#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish
Server]), as well as the database server (see
link:usingexamples004.html#BNADK[Starting and Stopping the Java DB
Server]).
2.  From the File menu, choose Open Project.
3.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
tut-install/examples/case-studies
----
4.  Select the `dukes-forest` folder.
5.  Select the Open Required Projects check box and click Open Project.
6.  Right-click the `dukes-forest` folder and select Build.
+
This task configures the server, creates and populates the database,
builds all the subprojects, assembles them into JAR and WAR files, and
deploys the `dukes-payment`, `dukes-store,` and `dukes-shipment`
applications.
+
To configure the server, this task creates a JDBC security realm named
jdbcRealm, enables default principal-to-role mapping, and enables single
sign-on (SSO) for the HTTP Service.
