58.1 Design and Architecture of Duke's Tutoring
-----------------------------------------------

Duke's Tutoring is a web application that incorporates several Java EE
technologies. It exposes both a main interface (for students, guardians,
and tutoring center staff) and an administration interface (for staff to
maintain the system). The business logic for both interfaces is provided
by enterprise beans. The enterprise beans use the Java Persistence API
to create and store the application's data in the database.
link:#CHDDJDCH[Figure 58-1] illustrates the architecture of the
application.

The Duke's Tutoring application is organized into two main projects: the
`dukes-tutoring-common` library and the `dukes-tutoring-war` web
application. The `dukes-tutoring-common` library project contains the
entity classes and helper classes used by the `dukes-tutoring-war` web
application, and `dukes-tutoring-common` is packaged and deployed with
`dukes-tutoring-war`. The library JAR file is useful for allowing the
entity classes and helper classes to be reused by other applications,
such as a JavaFX client application.

Duke's Tutoring uses the following Java EE 7 platform features:

* Java Persistence API entities

** A custom Bean Validation annotation, `@Email`, for validating email
addresses

** A standard `jta-data-source` definition that will create the JDBC
resource on deployment

** A standard property in the `persistence.xml` deployment descriptor to
automatically and portably create and delete the tables in the
`jta-data-source`
* Enterprise beans

** Local, no-interface view session and singleton beans

** JAX-RS resources in a session bean

** Java EE security constraints on the administrative interface business
methods

** All enterprise beans packaged within the WAR
* WebSocket

** A WebSocket server endpoint that automatically publishes the status
of students to client endpoints
* Contexts and Dependency Injection

** A CDI event that is fired when the status of a student changes

** Handler methods for updating the application once the status event is
fired

** CDI managed beans for Facelets pages

** Bean Validation annotations in the CDI managed beans
* JavaServer Faces technology, using Facelets for the web front end

** Templating

** Composite components

** A custom formatter, `PhoneNumberFormatter`

** Security constraints on the administrative interface

** Ajax-enabled Facelets components

The Duke's Tutoring application has two main user interfaces, both
packaged within a single WAR file:

* The main interface, for students, guardians, and staff
* The administrative interface used by the staff to manage the students
and guardians, and to generate attendance reports
