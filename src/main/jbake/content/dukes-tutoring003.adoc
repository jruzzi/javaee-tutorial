58.3 Administration Interface
-----------------------------

The administration interface of Duke's Tutoring is used by the tutoring
center staff to manage the data employed by the main interface: the
students, the students' guardians, and the addresses. The administration
interface uses many of the same components as the main interface.
Additional components that are only used in the administration interface
are described here.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#GKAEN[Section 58.3.1, "Enterprise Beans Used in the
Administration Interface"]
* link:#GKACB[Section 58.3.2, "Facelets Files Used in the Administration
Interface"]
* link:#BCGHIDEG[Section 58.3.3, "CDI Managed Beans Used in the
Administration Interface"]
* link:#BCGFFFCA[Section 58.3.4, "Helper Classes Used in the
Administration Interface"]

[[GKAEN]]

[[enterprise-beans-used-in-the-administration-interface]]
58.3.1 Enterprise Beans Used in the Administration Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following enterprise bean, in the `dukestutoring.ejb` package of the
`dukes-tutoring-war` project, is used in the administration interface.

* `AdminBean`: A stateless session bean for all the business logic used
in the administration interface. Calls security methods to allow
invocation of the business methods only by authorized users.

[[GKACB]]

[[facelets-files-used-in-the-administration-interface]]
58.3.2 Facelets Files Used in the Administration Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following Facelets files, under `src/main/webapp/`, are used in the
administration interface:

* `admin/adminTemplate.xhtml`: Template for the administration interface
* `admin/index.xhtml`: Landing page for the administration interface
* `login.xhtml`: Login page for the security-constrained administration
interface
* `loginError.xhtml`: Page displayed if there are errors authenticating
the administration user
* `admin/address` directory: Pages that allow you to create, edit, and
delete `Address` entities
* `admin/guardian` directory: Pages that allow you to create, edit, and
delete `Guardian` entities
* `admin/student` directory: Pages that allow you to create, edit, and
delete `Student` entities
* `resources/components/formLogin.xhtml`: Composite component for a
login form using Java EE security
* `WEB-INF/includes/adminNav.xhtml`: XHTML fragment for the
administration interface's navigation bar

[[BCGHIDEG]]

[[cdi-managed-beans-used-in-the-administration-interface]]
58.3.3 CDI Managed Beans Used in the Administration Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CDI managed beans used in the administration interface are located
in the `dukestutoring.web` package in the `dukes-tutoring-war` project.

* `StudentBean.java`: A managed bean for the Facelets pages used to
create and edit students. The first and last names have Bean Validation
annotations that require the fields to be filled in. The phone numbers
have Bean Validation annotations to ensure that the submitted data is
well-formed.
* `GuardianBean.java`: A managed bean for the Facelets pages used to
create guardians for and assign guardians to students. The first and
last names have Bean Validation annotations that require the fields to
be filled in. The phone numbers have Bean Validation annotations to
ensure that the submitted data is well-formed.
* `AddressBean.java`: A managed bean for the Facelets pages used to
create addresses for students. The street, city, province, and postal
code attributes have Bean Validation annotations that require the fields
to be filled in, and the postal code attribute has an additional
annotation to ensure that the data is properly formed.

[[BCGFFFCA]]

[[helper-classes-used-in-the-administration-interface]]
58.3.4 Helper Classes Used in the Administration Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following helper classes, found in the `dukes-tutoring-war`
project's `dukestutoring.web.util` package, are used in the
administration interface.

* `EntityConverter`: A parent class to `StudentConverter` and
`GuardianConverter` that defines a cache to store the entity classes
when converting the entities for use in JavaServer Faces user interface
components. The cache helps increase performance. The cache is stored in
the JavaServer Faces context.
* `StudentConverter`: A JavaServer Faces converter for the `Student`
entity class. This class contains methods to convert `Student` instances
to strings and back again, so they can be used in the user interface
components of the application.
* `GuardianConverter`: Similar to `StudentConverter`, this class is a
converter for the `Guardian` entity class.
