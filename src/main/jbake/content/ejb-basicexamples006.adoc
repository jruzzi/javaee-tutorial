34.6 Handling Exceptions
------------------------

The exceptions thrown by enterprise beans fall into two categories:
system and application.

A system exception indicates a problem with the services that support an
application. For example, a connection to an external resource cannot be
obtained, or an injected resource cannot be found. If it encounters a
system-level problem, your enterprise bean should throw a
`javax.ejb.EJBException`. Because the `EJBException` is a subclass of
`RuntimeException`, you do not have to specify it in the `throws` clause
of the method declaration. If a system exception is thrown, the EJB
container might destroy the bean instance. Therefore, a system exception
cannot be handled by the bean's client program, but instead requires
intervention by a system administrator.

An application exception signals an error in the business logic of an
enterprise bean. Application exceptions are typically exceptions that
you've coded yourself, such as the `BookException` thrown by the
business methods of the `CartBean` example. When an enterprise bean
throws an application exception, the container does not wrap it in
another exception. The client should be able to handle any application
exception it receives.

If a system exception occurs within a transaction, the EJB container
rolls back the transaction. However, if an application exception is
thrown within a transaction, the container does not roll back the
transaction.
