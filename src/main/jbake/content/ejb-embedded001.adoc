35.1 Overview of the Embedded Enterprise Bean Container
-------------------------------------------------------

The embedded enterprise bean container is used to access enterprise bean
components from client code executed in a Java SE environment. The
container and the client code are executed within the same virtual
machine. The embedded enterprise bean container is typically used for
testing enterprise beans without having to deploy them to a server.

Most of the services present in the enterprise bean container in a Java
EE server are available in the embedded enterprise bean container,
including injection, container-managed transactions, and security.
Enterprise bean components execute similarly in both embedded and Java
EE environments, and therefore the same enterprise bean can be easily
reused in both standalone and networked applications.
