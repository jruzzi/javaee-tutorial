33 Getting Started with Enterprise Beans
----------------------------------------


This chapter shows how to develop, deploy, and run a simple Java EE
application named `converter` that uses an EJB for its business logic.
The purpose of `converter` is to calculate currency conversions among
Japanese yen, euros, and US dollars. The `converter` application
consists of an enterprise bean, which performs the calculations, and a
web client.

The following topics are addressed here:
