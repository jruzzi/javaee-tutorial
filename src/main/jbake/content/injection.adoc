4 Injection
-----------


This chapter provides an overview of injection in Java EE and describes
the two injection mechanisms provided by the platform: resource
injection and dependency injection.

Java EE provides injection mechanisms that enable your objects to obtain
references to resources and other dependencies without having to
instantiate them directly. You declare the required resources and other
dependencies in your classes by decorating fields or methods with one of
the annotations that mark the field as an injection point. The container
then provides the required instances at runtime. Injection simplifies
your code and decouples it from the implementations of its dependencies.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:injection001.html#BABHDCAI[Resource Injection]
* link:injection002.html#BABDJGIE[Dependency Injection]
* link:injection003.html#BABHFECJ[The Main Differences between Resource
Injection and Dependency Injection]
