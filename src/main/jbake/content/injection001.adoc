4.1 Resource Injection
----------------------

Resource injection enables you to inject any resource available in the
JNDI namespace into any container-managed object, such as a servlet, an
enterprise bean, or a managed bean. For example, you can use resource
injection to inject data sources, connectors, or custom resources
available in the JNDI namespace.

The type you use for the reference to the injected instance is usually
an interface, which decouples your code from the implementation of the
resource.

For example, the following code injects a data source object that
provides connections to the default Java DB database shipped with
GlassFish Server:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultDataSource")
    private javax.sql.DataSource dsc;
    ...
}
----

In addition to field-based injection as in the preceding example, you
can inject resources using method-based injection:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private javax.sql.DataSource dsc;
    ...
    @Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultDataSource")
    public void setDsc(java.sql.DataSource ds) {
        dsc = ds;
    }
}
----

To use method-based injection, the setter method must follow the
JavaBeans conventions for property names: The method name must begin
with `set`, have a `void` return type, and have only one parameter.

The `@Resource` annotation is in the `javax.annotation` package and is
defined in JSR 250 (Common Annotations for the Java Platform). Resource
injection resolves by name, so it is not typesafe: the type of the
resource object is not known at compile time, so you can get runtime
errors if the types of the object and its reference do not match.
