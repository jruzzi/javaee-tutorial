31 JAX-RS: Advanced Topics and an Example
-----------------------------------------


The Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS, defined in JSR 339) is
designed to make it easy to develop applications that use the REST
architecture. This chapter describes advanced features of JAX-RS. If you
are new to JAX-RS, see link:jaxrs.html#GIEPU[Chapter 29, "Building
RESTful Web Services with JAX-RS"] before you proceed with this chapter.

JAX-RS is integrated with Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE
(CDI), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology, and Java Servlet
technology.

The following topics are addressed here:
