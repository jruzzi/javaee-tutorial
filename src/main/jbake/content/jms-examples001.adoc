46.1 Building and Running Java Message Service Examples
-------------------------------------------------------

The examples are in the tut-install`/examples/jms/` directory.

To build and run each example:

1.  Use NetBeans IDE or Maven to compile, package, and in some cases
deploy the example.
2.  Use NetBeans IDE, Maven, or the `appclient` command to run the
application client, or use the browser to run the web application
examples.

Before you deploy or run the examples, you need to create resources for
them. Some examples have a `glassfish-resources.xml` file that is used
to create resources for that example and others. You can use the
`asadmin` command to create the resources.

To use the `asadmin` and `appclient` commands, you need to put the
GlassFish Server `bin` directories in your command path, as described in
link:usingexamples001.html#GEXBC[SDK Installation Tips].
