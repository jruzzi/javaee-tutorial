46.7 Receiving Messages Asynchronously Using a Message-Driven Bean
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are writing an application to run in the Java EE application
client container or on the Java SE platform, and you want to receive
messages asynchronously, you need to define a class that implements the
`MessageListener` interface, create a `JMSConsumer`, and call the method
`setMessageListener`.

If you're writing an application to run in the Java EE web or EJB
container and want it to receive messages asynchronously, you also need
to need to define a class that implements the `MessageListener`
interface. However, instead of creating a `JMSConsumer` and calling the
method `setMessageListener`, you must configure your message listener
class to be a message-driven bean. The application server will then take
care of the rest.

Message-driven beans can implement any messaging type. Most commonly,
however, they implement the Java Message Service (JMS) technology.

This section describes a simple message-driven bean example. Before
proceeding, you should read the basic conceptual information in the
section link:ejb-intro003.html#GIPKO[What Is a Message-Driven Bean?] as
well as link:jms-concepts005.html#BNCGQ[Using Message-Driven Beans to
Receive Messages Asynchronously].

[[overview-of-the-simplemessage-example]]
46.7.1 Overview of the simplemessage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `simplemessage` application has the following components:

* `SimpleMessageClient`: An application client that sends several
messages to a queue
* `SimpleMessageBean`: A message-driven bean that asynchronously
processes the messages that are sent to the queue

link:#BNBPM[Figure 46-3] illustrates the structure of this application.
The application client sends messages to the queue, which was created
administratively using the Administration Console. The JMS provider (in
this case, GlassFish Server) delivers the messages to the instances of
the message-driven bean, which then processes the messages.

[[BNBPM]]

link:img_text/javaeett_dt_036.html[Description of "Figure 46-3 The
simplemessage Application"] +
 +

The source code for this application is in the
tut-install`/examples/jms/simplemessage/` directory.

[[BNBPN]]

[[the-simplemessage-application-client]]
46.7.2 The simplemessage Application Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `SimpleMessageClient` sends messages to the queue that the
`SimpleMessageBean` listens to. The client starts by injecting the
connection factory and queue resources:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Resource(lookup = "java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory")
private static ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@Resource(lookup = "jms/MyQueue")
private static Queue queue;
----

Next, the client creates the `JMSContext` in a `try`-with-resources
block:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
String text;
final int NUM_MSGS = 3;

try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();) {
----

Finally, the client sends several text messages to the queue:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_MSGS; i++) {
    text = "This is message " + (i + 1);
    System.out.println("Sending message: " + text);
    context.createProducer().send(queue, text);
}
----

[[BNBPO]]

[[the-simplemessage-message-driven-bean-class]]
46.7.3 The simplemessage Message-Driven Bean Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code for the `SimpleMessageBean` class illustrates the requirements
of a message-driven bean class described in
link:jms-concepts005.html#BNCGQ[Using Message-Driven Beans to Receive
Messages Asynchronously].

The first few lines of the `SimpleMessageBean` class use the
`@MessageDriven` annotation's `activationConfig` attribute to specify
configuration properties:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup",
            propertyValue = "jms/MyQueue"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType",
            propertyValue = "javax.jms.Queue")
})
----

See link:jms-concepts005.html#GJKOH[Table 45-3] for a list of the
available properties.

See link:jms-examples008.html#BNCGW[Sending Messages from a Session Bean
to an MDB] for examples of the `subscriptionDurability`, `clientId`,
`subscriptionName`, and `messageSelector` properties.

[[the-onmessage-method]]
46.7.3.1 The onMessage Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the queue receives a message, the EJB container invokes the message
listener method or methods. For a bean that uses JMS, this is the
`onMessage` method of the `MessageListener` interface.

In the `SimpleMessageBean` class, the `onMessage` method casts the
incoming message to a `TextMessage` and displays the text:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
public void onMessage(Message inMessage) {

    try {
        if (inMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
            logger.log(Level.INFO,
                    "MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: {0}",
                    inMessage.getBody(String.class));
        } else {
            logger.log(Level.WARNING,
                    "Message of wrong type: {0}",
                    inMessage.getClass().getName());
        }
    } catch (JMSException e) {
        logger.log(Level.SEVERE,
                "SimpleMessageBean.onMessage: JMSException: {0}",
                e.toString());
        mdc.setRollbackOnly();
    }
}

46.7.4 Running the simplemessage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, deploy, and run the
`simplemessage` example.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#BNBPR[Section 46.7.4.1, "Creating Resources for the
simplemessage Example"]
* link:#CHDFBDDA[Section 46.7.4.2, "To Run the simplemessage Example
Using NetBeans IDE"]
* link:#BNBPT[Section 46.7.4.3, "To Run the simplemessage Example Using
Maven"]

[[BNBPR]]

[[creating-resources-for-the-simplemessage-example]]
46.7.4.1 Creating Resources for the simplemessage Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example uses the queue named `jms/MyQueue` and the preconfigured
default connection factory `java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory`.

If you have run the simple JMS examples in
link:jms-examples003.html#BNCFA[Writing Simple JMS Applications] and have
not deleted the resources, you already have the queue. Otherwise, follow
the instructions in link:jms-examples003.html#BABHEFCB[To Create
Resources for the Simple Examples] to create it.

For more information on creating JMS resources, see
link:jms-examples003.html#GKTJS[Creating JMS Administered Objects].

[[CHDFBDDA]]

[[to-run-the-simplemessage-example-using-netbeans-ide]]
46.7.4.2 To Run the simplemessage Example Using NetBeans IDE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see
link:usingexamples002.html#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish
Server]).
2.  From the File menu, choose Open Project.
3.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
tut-install/examples/jms/simplemessage
----
4.  Select the `simplemessage` folder.
5.  Make sure that the Open Required Projects check box is selected,
then click Open Project.
6.  In the Projects tab, right-click the `simplemessage` project and
select Build. (If NetBeans IDE suggests that you run a priming build,
click the box to do so.)
+
This command packages the application client and the message-driven
bean, then creates a file named `simplemessage.ear` in the
`simplemessage-ear/target/` directory. It then deploys the
`simplemessage-ear` module, retrieves the client stubs, and runs the
application client.
+
The output in the output window looks like this (preceded by application
client container output):
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Sending message: This is message 1
Sending message: This is message 2
Sending message: This is message 3
To see if the bean received the messages,
 check <install_dir>/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
----
+
In the server log file, lines similar to the following appear:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 1
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 2
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 3
----
+
The received messages may appear in a different order from the order in
which they were sent.
7.  After you have finished running the application, undeploy it using
the Services tab.

[[BNBPT]]

[[to-run-the-simplemessage-example-using-maven]]
46.7.4.3 To Run the simplemessage Example Using Maven
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see
link:usingexamples002.html#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish
Server]).
2.  In a terminal window, go to:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
tut-install/examples/jms/simplemessage/
----
3.  To compile the source files and package the application, use the
following command:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
mvn install
----
+
This target packages the application client and the message-driven bean,
then creates a file named `simplemessage.ear` in the
`simplemessage-ear/target/` directory. It then deploys the
`simplemessage-ear` module, retrieves the client stubs, and runs the
application client.
+
The output in the terminal window looks like this (preceded by
application client container output):
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Sending message: This is message 1
Sending message: This is message 2
Sending message: This is message 3
To see if the bean received the messages,
 check <install_dir>/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
----
+
In the server log file, lines similar to the following appear:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 1
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 2
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 3
----
+
The received messages may appear in a different order from the order in
which they were sent.
4.  After you have finished running the application, undeploy it using
the `mvn cargo:undeploy` command.
