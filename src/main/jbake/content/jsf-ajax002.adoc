13.2 Using Ajax Functionality with JavaServer Faces Technology
--------------------------------------------------------------

Ajax functionality can be added to a JavaServer Faces application in one
of the following ways:

* Adding the required JavaScript code to an application
* Using the built-in Ajax resource library

In earlier releases of the Java EE platform, JavaServer Faces
applications provided Ajax functionality by adding the necessary
JavaScript to the web page. In the Java EE 7 platform, standard Ajax
support is provided by a built-in JavaScript resource library.

With the support of this JavaScript resource library, JavaServer Faces
standard UI components, such as buttons, labels, or text fields, can be
enabled for Ajax functionality. You can also load this resource library
and use its methods directly from within the managed bean code. The next
sections of the tutorial describe the use of the built-in Ajax resource
library.

In addition, because the JavaServer Faces technology component model can
be extended, custom components can be created with Ajax functionality.

The tutorial examples include an Ajax version of the `guessnumber`
application, `ajaxguessnumber`. See link:jsf-ajax011.html#GKOKB[The
ajaxguessnumber Example Application] for more information.

The Ajax specific `f:ajax` tag and its attributes are explained in the
next sections.
