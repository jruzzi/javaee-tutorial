13.8 Ajax Request Lifecycle
---------------------------

An Ajax request varies from other typical JavaServer Faces requests, and
its processing is also handled differently by the JavaServer Faces
lifecycle.

As described in link:jsf-intro008.html#GKNOJ[Partial Processing and
Partial Rendering], when an Ajax request is received, the state
associated with that request is captured by the
`javax.faces.context.PartialViewContext`. This object provides access to
information such as which components are targeted for
processing/rendering. The `processPartial` method of
`PartialViewContext` uses this information to perform partial component
tree processing and rendering.

The `execute` attribute of the `f:ajax` tag identifies which segments of
the server-side component tree should be processed. Because components
can be uniquely identified in the JavaServer Faces component tree, it is
easy to identify and process a single component, a few components, or a
whole tree. This is made possible by the `visitTree` method of the
`UIComponent` class. The identified components then run through the
JavaServer Faces request lifecycle phases.

Similar to the `execute` attribute, the `render` attribute identifies
which segments of the JavaServer Faces component tree need to be
rendered during the render response phase.

During the render response phase, the `render` attribute is examined.
The identified components are found and asked to render themselves and
their children. The components are then packaged up and sent back to the
client as a response.
