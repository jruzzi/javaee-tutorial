9 Expression Language
---------------------


This chapter introduces the Expression Language (also referred to as the
EL), which provides an important mechanism for enabling the presentation
layer (web pages) to communicate with the application logic (managed
beans). The EL is used by several JavaEE technologies, such as
JavaServer Faces technology, JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology, and
Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE (CDI). The EL can also be
used in stand-alone environments. This chapter only covers the use of
the EL in Java EE containers.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:jsf-el001.html#BNAHQ[Overview of the EL]
* link:jsf-el002.html#BNAHR[Immediate and Deferred Evaluation Syntax]
* link:jsf-el003.html#BNAHU[Value and Method Expressions]
