9.1 Overview of the EL
----------------------

The EL allows page authors to use simple expressions to dynamically
access data from JavaBeans components. For example, the `test` attribute
of the following conditional tag is supplied with an EL expression that
compares 0 with the number of items in the session-scoped bean named
`cart`.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<c:if test="${sessionScope.cart.numberOfItems > 0}">
  ...
</c:if>
----

See link:jsf-develop001.html#BNAQP[Using the EL to Reference Managed
Beans] for more information on how to use the EL in JavaServer Faces
applications.

To summarize, the EL provides a way to use simple expressions to perform
the following tasks:

* Dynamically read application data stored in JavaBeans components,
various data structures, and implicit objects
* Dynamically write data, such as user input into forms, to JavaBeans
components
* Invoke arbitrary static and public methods
* Dynamically perform arithmetic, boolean, and string operations
* Dynamically construct collection objects and perform operations on
collections

In a JavaServer Faces page, an EL expression can be used either in
static text or in the attribute of a custom tag or standard action.

Finally, the EL provides a pluggable API for resolving expressions so
that custom resolvers that can handle expressions not already supported
by the EL can be implemented.
