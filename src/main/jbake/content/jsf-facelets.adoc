8 Introduction to Facelets
--------------------------


The term Facelets refers to the view declaration language for JavaServer
Faces technology. Facelets is a part of the JavaServer Faces
specification and also the preferred presentation technology for
building JavaServer Faces technology–based applications. JavaServer
Pages (JSP) technology, previously used as the presentation technology
for JavaServer Faces, does not support all the new features available in
JavaServer Faces in the Java EE 7 platform. JSP technology is considered
to be a deprecated presentation technology for JavaServer Faces.
