7.2 What Is a JavaServer Faces Application?
-------------------------------------------

The functionality provided by a JavaServer Faces application is similar
to that of any other Java web application. A typical JavaServer Faces
application includes the following parts.

* A set of web pages in which components are laid out.
* A set of tags to add components to the web page.
* A set of managed beans, which are lightweight, container-managed
objects (POJOs). In a JavaServer Faces application, managed beans serve
as backing beans, which define properties and functions for UI
components on a page.
* A web deployment descriptor (`web.xml` file).
* Optionally, one or more application configuration resource files, such
as a `faces-config.xml` file, which can be used to define page
navigation rules and configure beans and other custom objects, such as
custom components.
* Optionally, a set of custom objects, which can include custom
components, validators, converters, or listeners, created by the
application developer.
* Optionally, a set of custom tags for representing custom objects on
the page.

link:#BNAPI[Figure 7-1] shows the interaction between client and server
in a typical JavaServer Faces application. In response to a client
request, a web page is rendered by the web container that implements
JavaServer Faces technology.

a Client Request for a JavaServer Faces Page"] +
 +

The web page, `myfacelet.xhtml`, is built using JavaServer Faces
component tags. Component tags are used to add components to the `view`
(represented by `myView` in the diagram), which is the server-side
representation of the page. In addition to components, the web page can
also reference objects, such as the following:

* Any event listeners, validators, and converters that are registered on
the components
* The JavaBeans components that capture the data and process the
application-specific functionality of the components

On request from the client, the view is rendered as a response.
Rendering is the process whereby, based on the server-side view, the web
container generates output, such as HTML or XHTML, that can be read by
the client, such as a browser.
