5.4 Packaging Resource Adapter Archives
---------------------------------------

A Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file stores XML files, Java classes,
and other objects for Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA) applications.
A resource adapter can be deployed on any Java EE server, much like a
Java EE application. A RAR file can be contained in an Enterprise
Archive (EAR) file, or it can exist as a separate file.

The RAR file contains

* A JAR file with the implementation classes of the resource adapter
* An optional `META-INF/` directory that can store an `ra.xml` file
and/or an application server–specific deployment descriptor used for
configuration purposes

A RAR file can be deployed on the application server as a standalone
component or as part of a larger application. In both cases, the adapter
is available to all applications using a lookup procedure.
