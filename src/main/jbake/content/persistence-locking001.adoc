42.1 Overview of Entity Locking and Concurrency
-----------------------------------------------

Entity data is concurrently accessed if the data in a data source is
accessed at the same time by multiple applications. Ensure that the
underlying data's integrity is preserved when it is accessed
concurrently.

When data is updated in the database tables in a transaction, the
persistence provider assumes the database management system will hold
short-term read locks and long-term write locks to maintain data
integrity. Most persistence providers will delay database writes until
the end of the transaction, except when the application explicitly calls
for a flush (that is, the application calls the `EntityManager.flush`
method or executes queries with the flush mode set to `AUTO`).

By default, persistence providers use optimistic locking, where, before
committing changes to the data, the persistence provider checks that no
other transaction has modified or deleted the data since the data was
read. This is accomplished by a version column in the database table,
with a corresponding version attribute in the entity class. When a row
is modified, the version value is incremented. The original transaction
checks the version attribute, and if the data has been modified by
another transaction, a `javax.persistence.OptimisticLockException` will
be thrown, and the original transaction will be rolled back. When the
application specifies optimistic lock modes, the persistence provider
verifies that a particular entity has not changed since it was read from
the database even if the entity data was not modified.

Pessimistic locking goes further than optimistic locking. With
pessimistic locking, the persistence provider creates a transaction that
obtains a long-term lock on the data until the transaction is completed,
which prevents other transactions from modifying or deleting the data
until the lock has ended. Pessimistic locking is a better strategy than
optimistic locking when the underlying data is frequently accessed and
modified by many transactions.

Note:

Using pessimistic locks on entities that are not subject to frequent
modification may result in decreased application performance.

42.1.1 Using Optimistic Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the `javax.persistence.Version` annotation to mark a persistent
field or property as a version attribute of an entity. The version
attribute enables the entity for optimistic concurrency control. The
persistence provider reads and updates the version attribute when an
entity instance is modified during a transaction. The application may
read the version attribute, but must not modify the value.

|=======================================================================

Note:

Although some persistence providers may support optimistic locking for
entities that do not have version attributes, portable applications
should always use entities with version attributes when using optimistic
locking. If the application attempts to lock an entity that does not
have a version attribute, and the persistence provider does not support
optimistic locking for non-versioned entities, a `PersistenceException`
will be thrown.

|=======================================================================

 +

The `@Version` annotation has the following requirements.

* Only a single `@Version` attribute may be defined per entity.
* The `@Version` attribute must be in the primary table for an entity
mapped to multiple tables.
* The type of the `@Version` attribute must be one of the following:
`int`, `Integer`, `long`, `Long`, `short`, `Short`, or
`java.sql.Timestamp`.

The following code snippet shows how to define a version attribute in an
entity with persistent fields:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Version
protected int version;
----

The following code snippet shows how to define a version attribute in an
entity with persistent properties:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Version
protected Short getVersion() { ... }
----
