39.2 Query Language Terminology
-------------------------------

The following list defines some of the terms referred to in this
chapter.

* Abstract schema: The persistent schema abstraction (persistent
entities, their state, and their relationships) over which queries
operate. The query language translates queries over this persistent
schema abstraction into queries that are executed over the database
schema to which entities are mapped.
* Abstract schema type: The type to which the persistent property of an
entity evaluates in the abstract schema. That is, each persistent field
or property in an entity has a corresponding state field of the same
type in the abstract schema. The abstract schema type of an entity is
derived from the entity class and the metadata information provided by
Java language annotations.
* Backus-Naur Form (BNF): A notation that describes the syntax of
high-level languages. The syntax diagrams in this chapter are in BNF
notation.
* Navigation: The traversal of relationships in a query language
expression. The navigation operator is a period.
* Path expression: An expression that navigates to an entity's state or
relationship field.
* State field: A persistent field of an entity.
* Relationship field: A persistent field of an entity whose type is the
abstract schema type of the related entity.
