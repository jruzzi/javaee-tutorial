39.4 Simplified Query Language Syntax
-------------------------------------

This section briefly describes the syntax of the query language so that
you can quickly move on to
link:persistence-querylanguage005.html#BNBTL[Example Queries]. When you
are ready to learn about the syntax in more detail, see
link:persistence-querylanguage006.html#BNBUF[Full Query Language Syntax].

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#BNBTJ[Section 39.4.1, "Select Statements"]
* link:#BNBTK[Section 39.4.2, "Update and Delete Statements"]

[[BNBTJ]]

[[select-statements]]
39.4.1 Select Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A select query has six clauses: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`,
`HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`. The `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses are required,
but the `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses are
optional. Here is the high-level BNF syntax of a query language select
query:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
QL_statement ::= select_clause from_clause 
  [where_clause][groupby_clause][having_clause][orderby_clause]
----

The BNF syntax defines the following clauses.

* The `SELECT` clause defines the types of the objects or values
returned by the query.
* The `FROM` clause defines the scope of the query by declaring one or
more identification variables, which can be referenced in the `SELECT`
and `WHERE` clauses. An identification variable represents one of the
following elements:

** The abstract schema name of an entity

** An element of a collection relationship

** An element of a single-valued relationship

** A member of a collection that is the multiple side of a one-to-many
relationship
* The `WHERE` clause is a conditional expression that restricts the
objects or values retrieved by the query. Although the clause is
optional, most queries have a `WHERE` clause.
* The `GROUP BY` clause groups query results according to a set of
properties.
* The `HAVING` clause is used with the `GROUP BY` clause to further
restrict the query results according to a conditional expression.
* The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the objects or values returned by the
query into a specified order.

[[BNBTK]]

[[update-and-delete-statements]]
39.4.2 Update and Delete Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update and delete statements provide bulk operations over sets of
entities. These statements have the following syntax:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
update_statement :: = update_clause [where_clause] 
delete_statement :: = delete_clause [where_clause]
----

The update and delete clauses determine the type of the entities to be
updated or deleted. The `WHERE` clause may be used to restrict the scope
of the update or delete operation.
