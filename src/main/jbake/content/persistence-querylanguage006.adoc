[[identifiers]]
39.6.3.1 Identifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An identifier is a sequence of one or more characters. The first
character must be a valid first character (letter, `$`, `_`) in an
identifier of the Java programming language, hereafter in this chapter
called simply "Java." Each subsequent character in the sequence must be
a valid nonfirst character (letter, digit, `$`, `_`) in a Java
identifier. (For details, see the Java SE API documentation of the
`isJavaIdentifierStart` and `isJavaIdentifierPart` methods of the
`Character` class.) The question mark (`?`) is a reserved character in
the query language and cannot be used in an identifier.

A query language identifier is case-sensitive, with two exceptions:

* Keywords
* Identification variables

An identifier cannot be the same as a query language keyword. Here is a
list of query language keywords:

`ABS` +
`ALL` +
`AND` +
`ANY` +
`AS` +
`ASC` +
`AVG` +
`BETWEEN` +
`BIT_LENGTH` +
`BOTH` +
`BY` +
`CASE` +
`CHAR_LENGTH` +
`CHARACTER_LENGTH` +
`CLASS` +
`COALESCE` +
`CONCAT` +
`COUNT` +
`CURRENT_DATE` +
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` +
`DELETE` +
`DESC` +
`DISTINCT` +
`ELSE` +
`EMPTY` +
`END` +
`ENTRY` +
`ESCAPE` +
`EXISTS` +
`FALSE` +
`FETCH` +
`FROM` +
`GROUP` +
`HAVING` +
`IN` +
`INDEX` +
`INNER` +
`IS` +
`JOIN` +
`KEY` +
`LEADING` +
`LEFT` +
`LENGTH` +
`LIKE` +
`LOCATE` +
`LOWER` +
`MAX` +
`MEMBER` +
`MIN` +
`MOD` +
`NEW` +
`NOT` +
`NULL` +
`NULLIF` +
`OBJECT` +
`OF` +
`OR` +
`ORDER` +
`OUTER` +
`POSITION` +
`SELECT` +
`SET` +
`SIZE` +
`SOME` +
`SQRT` +
`SUBSTRING` +
`SUM` +
`THEN` +
`TRAILING` +
`TRIM` +
`TRUE` +
`TYPE` +
`UNKNOWN` +
`UPDATE` +
`UPPER` +
`VALUE` +
`WHEN` +
`WHERE` +

It is not recommended that you use an SQL keyword as an identifier,
because the list of keywords may expand to include other reserved SQL
words in the future.

[[BNBUM]]

[[identification-variables]]
39.6.3.2 Identification Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An identification variable is an identifier declared in the `FROM`
clause. Although they can reference identification variables, the
`SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses cannot declare them. All identification
variables must be declared in the `FROM` clause.

Because it is an identifier, an identification variable has the same
naming conventions and restrictions as an identifier, with the exception
that an identification variable is case-insensitive. For example, an
identification variable cannot be the same as a query language keyword.
(See link:#BNBUK[Identifiers] for more naming rules.) Also, within a
given persistence unit, an identification variable name must not match
the name of any entity or abstract schema.

The `FROM` clause can contain multiple declarations, separated by
commas. A declaration can reference another identification variable that
has been previously declared (to the left). In the following `FROM`
clause, the variable `t` references the previously declared variable
`p`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) AS t
----

Even if it is not used in the `WHERE` clause, an identification
variable's declaration can affect the results of the query. For example,
compare the next two queries. The following query returns all players,
whether or not they belong to a team:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT p
FROM Player p
----

In contrast, because it declares the `t` identification variable, the
next query fetches all players who belong to a team:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT p
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) AS t
----

The following query returns the same results as the preceding query, but
the `WHERE` clause makes it easier to read:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT p
FROM Player p
WHERE p.teams IS NOT EMPTY
----

An identification variable always designates a reference to a single
value whose type is that of the expression used in the declaration.
There are two kinds of declarations: range variable and collection
member.

[[BNBUN]]

[[range-variable-declarations]]
39.6.3.3 Range Variable Declarations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To declare an identification variable as an abstract schema type, you
specify a range variable declaration. In other words, an identification
variable can range over the abstract schema type of an entity. In the
following example, an identification variable named `p` represents the
abstract schema named `Player`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
FROM Player p
----

A range variable declaration can include the optional `AS` operator:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
FROM Player AS p
----

To obtain objects, a query usually uses path expressions to navigate
through the relationships. But for those objects that cannot be obtained
by navigation, you can use a range variable declaration to designate a
starting point, or query root.

If the query compares multiple values of the same abstract schema type,
the `FROM` clause must declare multiple identification variables for the
abstract schema:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
FROM Player p1, Player p2
----

For an example of such a query, see
link:persistence-querylanguage005.html#BNBUB[Comparison Operators].

[[BNBUO]]

[[collection-member-declarations]]
39.6.3.4 Collection Member Declarations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a one-to-many relationship, the multiple side consists of a
collection of entities. An identification variable can represent a
member of this collection. To access a collection member, the path
expression in the variable's declaration navigates through the
relationships in the abstract schema. (For more information on path
expressions, see link:#BNBUQ[Path Expressions].) Because a path
expression can be based on another path expression, the navigation can
traverse several relationships. See
link:persistence-querylanguage005.html#BNBTU[Traversing Multiple
Relationships].

A collection member declaration must include the `IN` operator but can
omit the optional `AS` operator.

In the following example, the entity represented by the abstract schema
named `Player` has a relationship field called `teams`. The
identification variable called `t` represents a single member of the
`teams` collection:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) t
----

[[BNBUP]]

[[joins]]
39.6.3.5 Joins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `JOIN` operator is used to traverse over relationships between
entities and is functionally similar to the `IN` operator.

In the following example, the query joins over the relationship between
customers and orders:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o
WHERE c.status = 1 AND o.totalPrice > 10000
----

The `INNER` keyword is optional:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c INNER JOIN c.orders o
WHERE c.status = 1 AND o.totalPrice > 10000
----

These examples are equivalent to the following query, which uses the
`IN` operator:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c, IN (c.orders) o
WHERE c.status = 1 AND o.totalPrice > 10000
----

You can also join a single-valued relationship:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT t
FROM Team t JOIN t.league l
WHERE l.sport = :sport
----

A `LEFT JOIN` or `LEFT OUTER JOIN` retrieves a set of entities where
matching values in the join condition may be absent. The `OUTER` keyword
is optional:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c.name, o.totalPrice
FROM CustomerOrder o LEFT JOIN o.customer c
----

A `FETCH JOIN` is a join operation that returns associated entities as a
side effect of running the query. In the following example, the query
returns a set of departments and, as a side effect, the associated
employees of the departments, even though the employees were not
explicitly retrieved by the `SELECT` clause:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT d
FROM Department d LEFT JOIN FETCH d.employees
WHERE d.deptno = 1
----

[[BNBUQ]]

[[path-expressions]]
39.6.4 Path Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path expressions are important constructs in the syntax of the query
language for several reasons. First, path expressions define navigation
paths through the relationships in the abstract schema. These path
definitions affect both the scope and the results of a query. Second,
path expressions can appear in any of the main clauses of a query
(`SELECT`, `DELETE`, `HAVING`, `UPDATE`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, `GROUP BY`,
`ORDER BY`). Finally, although much of the query language is a subset of
SQL, path expressions are extensions not found in SQL.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#BNBUR[Section 39.6.4.1, "Examples of Path Expressions"]
* link:#BNBUS[Section 39.6.4.2, "Expression Types"]
* link:#BNBUT[Section 39.6.4.3, "Navigation"]

[[BNBUR]]

[[examples-of-path-expressions]]
39.6.4.1 Examples of Path Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, the `WHERE` clause contains a `single_valued_path_expression`; the
`p` is an identification variable, and `salary` is a persistent field of
`Player`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p
FROM Player p
WHERE p.salary BETWEEN :lowerSalary AND :higherSalary
----

Here, the `WHERE` clause also contains a
`single_valued_path_expression`; `t` is an identification variable,
`league` is a single-valued relationship field, and `sport` is a
persistent field of `league`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) t
WHERE t.league.sport = :sport
----

Here, the `WHERE` clause contains a `collection_valued_path_expression`;
`p` is an identification variable, and `teams` designates a
collection-valued relationship field:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p
FROM Player p
WHERE p.teams IS EMPTY
----

[[BNBUS]]

[[expression-types]]
39.6.4.2 Expression Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The type of a path expression is the type of the object represented by
the ending element, which can be one of the following:

* Persistent field
* Single-valued relationship field
* Collection-valued relationship field

For example, the type of the expression `p.salary` is `double` because
the terminating persistent field (`salary`) is a `double`.

In the expression `p.teams`, the terminating element is a
collection-valued relationship field (`teams`). This expression's type
is a collection of the abstract schema type named `Team`. Because `Team`
is the abstract schema name for the `Team` entity, this type maps to the
entity. For more information on the type mapping of abstract schemas,
see link:#BNBVY[Return Types].

[[BNBUT]]

[[navigation]]
39.6.4.3 Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A path expression enables the query to navigate to related entities. The
terminating elements of an expression determine whether navigation is
allowed. If an expression contains a single-valued relationship field,
the navigation can continue to an object that is related to the field.
However, an expression cannot navigate beyond a persistent field or a
collection-valued relationship field. For example, the expression
`p.teams.league.sport` is illegal because `teams` is a collection-valued
relationship field. To reach the `sport` field, the `FROM` clause could
define an identification variable named `t` for the `teams` field:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
FROM Player AS p, IN (p.teams) t
WHERE t.league.sport = 'soccer'
----

[[BNBUU]]

[[where-clause]]
39.6.5 WHERE Clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `WHERE` clause specifies a conditional expression that limits the
values returned by the query. The query returns all corresponding values
in the data store for which the conditional expression is `TRUE`.
Although usually specified, the `WHERE` clause is optional. If the
`WHERE` clause is omitted, the query returns all values. The high-level
syntax for the `WHERE` clause is as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
where_clause ::= WHERE conditional_expression
----

[[BNBUV]]

[[literals]]
39.6.5.1 Literals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are four kinds of literals: string, numeric, Boolean, and enum.

* String literals: A string literal is enclosed in single quotes:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
'Duke'
----
+
If a string literal contains a single quote, you indicate the quote by
using two single quotes:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
'Duke''s'
----
+
Like a Java `String`, a string literal in the query language uses the
Unicode character encoding.
* Numeric literals: There are two types of numeric literals: exact and
approximate.

** An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal point,
such as 65, –233, and +12. Using the Java integer syntax, exact numeric
literals support numbers in the range of a Java `long`.

** An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in scientific
notation, such as 57., –85.7, and +2.1. Using the syntax of the Java
floating-point literal, approximate numeric literals support numbers in
the range of a Java `double`.
* Boolean literals: A Boolean literal is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These
keywords are not case-sensitive.
* Enum literals: The Java Persistence query language supports the use of
enum literals using the Java enum literal syntax. The enum class name
must be specified as a fully qualified class name:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.status = com.example.EmployeeStatus.FULL_TIME
----

[[BNBVA]]

[[input-parameters]]
39.6.5.2 Input Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An input parameter can be either a named parameter or a positional
parameter.

* A named input parameter is designated by a colon (`:`) followed by a
string; for example, `:name`.
* A positional input parameter is designated by a question mark (`?`)
followed by an integer. For example, the first input parameter is `?1`,
the second is `?2`, and so forth.

The following rules apply to input parameters.

* They can be used only in a `WHERE` or `HAVING` clause.
* Positional parameters must be numbered, starting with the integer 1.
* Named parameters and positional parameters may not be mixed in a
single query.
* Named parameters are case-sensitive.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A `WHERE` clause consists of a conditional expression, which is
evaluated from left to right within a precedence level. You can change
the order of evaluation by using parentheses.

[[between-expressions]]
39.6.5.5 BETWEEN Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A `BETWEEN` expression determines whether an arithmetic expression falls
within a range of values.

These two expressions are equivalent:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
p.age BETWEEN 15 AND 19
p.age >= 15 AND p.age <= 19
----

The following two expressions also are equivalent:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
p.age NOT BETWEEN 15 AND 19
p.age < 15 OR p.age > 19
----

If an arithmetic expression has a `NULL` value, the value of the
`BETWEEN` expression is unknown.

[[BNBVF]]

[[in-expressions]]
39.6.5.6 IN Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An `IN` expression determines whether a string belongs to a set of
string literals or whether a number belongs to a set of number values.

The path expression must have a string or numeric value. If the path
expression has a `NULL` value, the value of the `IN` expression is
unknown.

In the following example, the expression is `TRUE` if the country is
`UK` , but `FALSE` if the country is `Peru`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
o.country IN ('UK', 'US', 'France')
----

You may also use input parameters:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
o.country IN ('UK', 'US', 'France', :country)
----

[[BNBVG]]

[[like-expressions]]
39.6.5.7 LIKE Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A `LIKE` expression determines whether a wildcard pattern matches a
string.

The path expression must have a string or numeric value. If this value
is `NULL`, the value of the `LIKE` expression is unknown. The pattern
value is a string literal that can contain wildcard characters. The
underscore (`_`) wildcard character represents any single character. The
percent (`%`) wildcard character represents zero or more characters. The
`ESCAPE` clause specifies an escape character for the wildcard
characters in the pattern value. link:#BNBVH[Table 39-3] shows some
sample `LIKE` expressions.

[[sthref169]][[BNBVH]]

[[BNBVI]]

[[null-comparison-expressions]]
39.6.5.8 NULL Comparison Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A `NULL` comparison expression tests whether a single-valued path
expression or an input parameter has a `NULL` value. Usually, the `NULL`
comparison expression is used to test whether a single-valued
relationship has been set:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT t
FROM Team t
WHERE t.league IS NULL
----

This query selects all teams where the league relationship is not set.
Note that the following query is not equivalent:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT t
FROM Team t
WHERE t.league = NULL
----

The comparison with `NULL` using the equals operator (`=`) always
returns an unknown value, even if the relationship is not set. The
second query will always return an empty result.

[[BNBVJ]]

[[empty-collection-comparison-expressions]]
39.6.5.9 Empty Collection Comparison Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `IS [NOT] EMPTY` comparison expression tests whether a
collection-valued path expression has no elements. In other words, it
tests whether a collection-valued relationship has been set.

If the collection-valued path expression is `NULL`, the empty collection
comparison expression has a `NULL` value.

Here is an example that finds all orders that do not have any line
items:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT o
FROM CustomerOrder o
WHERE o.lineItems IS EMPTY
----

[[BNBVK]]

[[collection-member-expressions]]
39.6.5.10 Collection Member Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `[NOT]` `MEMBER [OF]` collection member expression determines
whether a value is a member of a collection. The value and the
collection members must have the same type.

If either the collection-valued or single-valued path expression is
unknown, the collection member expression is unknown. If the
collection-valued path expression designates an empty collection, the
collection member expression is `FALSE`.

The `OF` keyword is optional.

The following example tests whether a line item is part of an order:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT o
FROM CustomerOrder o
WHERE :lineItem MEMBER OF o.lineItems
----

[[BNBVL]]

[[subqueries]]
39.6.5.11 Subqueries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Subqueries may be used in the `WHERE` or `HAVING` clause of a query.
Subqueries must be surrounded by parentheses.

The following example finds all customers who have placed more than ten
orders:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(o) FROM c.orders o)> 10
----

Subqueries may contain `EXISTS`, `ALL`, and `ANY` expressions.

* EXISTS expressions: The `[NOT] EXISTS` expression is used with a
subquery and is true only if the result of the subquery consists of one
or more values; otherwise, it is false.
+
The following example finds all employees whose spouses are also
employees:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT DISTINCT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT spouseEmp
    FROM Employee spouseEmp
    WHERE spouseEmp = emp.spouse)
----
* ALL and ANY expressions: The `ALL` expression is used with a subquery
and is true if all the values returned by the subquery are true or if
the subquery is empty.
+
The `ANY` expression is used with a subquery and is true if some of the
values returned by the subquery are true. An `ANY` expression is false
if the subquery result is empty or if all the values returned are false.
The `SOME` keyword is synonymous with `ANY`.
+
The `ALL` and `ANY` expressions are used with the `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`,
`>=`, and `<>` comparison operators.
+
The following example finds all employees whose salaries are higher than
the salaries of the managers in the employee's department:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE emp.salary > ALL (
    SELECT m.salary
    FROM Manager m
    WHERE m.department = emp.department)
----

[[BNBVO]]

[[functional-expressions]]
39.6.5.12 Functional Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The query language includes several string, arithmetic, and date/time
functions that may be used in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clause
of a query. The functions are listed in link:#BNBVP[Table 39-4],
link:#BNBVQ[Table 39-5], and link:#GJJNL[Table 39-6].

In link:#BNBVP[Table 39-4], the `start` and `length` arguments are of
type `int` and designate positions in the `String` argument. The first
position in a string is designated by 1.

[[sthref170]][[BNBVP]]

Table 39-4 String Expressions

[width="28%",cols=",100%",options="header",]
|==============================================================
|Function Syntax |Return Type
|`CONCAT(String, String)` |`String`
|`LENGTH(String)` |`int`
|`LOCATE(String, String [, start])` |`int`
|`SUBSTRING(String, start, length)` |`String`
|`TRIM([[LEADING|TRAILING|BOTH] char) FROM] (String)` |`String`
|`LOWER(String)` |`String`
|`UPPER(String)` |`String`
|==============================================================


The `CONCAT` function concatenates two strings into one string.

The `LENGTH` function returns the length of a string in characters as an
integer.

The `LOCATE` function returns the position of a given string within a
string. This function returns the first position at which the string was
found as an integer. The first argument is the string to be located. The
second argument is the string to be searched. The optional third
argument is an integer that represents the starting string position. By
default, `LOCATE` starts at the beginning of the string. The starting
position of a string is `1`. If the string cannot be located, `LOCATE`
returns `0`.

The `SUBSTRING` function returns a string that is a substring of the
first argument based on the starting position and length.

The `TRIM` function trims the specified character from the beginning
and/or end of a string. If no character is specified, `TRIM` removes
spaces or blanks from the string. If the optional `LEADING`
specification is used, `TRIM` removes only the leading characters from
the string. If the optional `TRAILING` specification is used, `TRIM`
removes only the trailing characters from the string. The default is
`BOTH`, which removes the leading and trailing characters from the
string.

The `LOWER` and `UPPER` functions convert a string to lowercase or
uppercase, respectively.

In link:#BNBVQ[Table 39-5], the `number` argument can be an `int`, a
`float`, or a `double`.

[[sthref171]][[BNBVQ]]

Table 39-5 Arithmetic Expressions

[width="38%",cols=",100%",options="header",]

|`ABS(number)` |`int`, `float`, or `double`
|`MOD(int, int)` |`int`
|`SQRT(double)` |`double`
|`SIZE(Collection)` |`int`
|==========================================


The `ABS` function takes a numeric expression and returns a number of
the same type as the argument.

The `MOD` function returns the remainder of the first argument divided
by the second.

The `SQRT` function returns the square root of a number.

The `SIZE` function returns an integer of the number of elements in the
given collection.

In link:#GJJNL[Table 39-6], the date/time functions return the date,
time, or timestamp on the database server.

[[case-expressions]]
39.6.5.13 Case Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Case expressions change based on a condition, similar to the `case`
keyword of the Java programming language. The `CASE` keyword indicates
the start of a case expression, and the expression is terminated by the
`END` keyword. The `WHEN` and `THEN` keywords define individual
conditions, and the `ELSE` keyword defines the default condition should
none of the other conditions be satisfied.

The following query selects the name of a person and a conditional
string, depending on the subtype of the `Person` entity. If the subtype
is `Student`, the string `kid` is returned. If the subtype is `Guardian`
or `Staff`, the string `adult` is returned. If the entity is some other
subtype of `Person`, the string `unknown` is returned:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT p.name
CASE TYPE(p)
    WHEN Student THEN 'kid'
    WHEN Guardian THEN 'adult'
    WHEN Staff THEN 'adult'
    ELSE 'unknown'
END
FROM Person p
----

The following query sets a discount for various types of customers.
Gold-level customers get a 20% discount, silver-level customers get a
15% discount, bronze-level customers get a 10% discount, and everyone
else gets a 5% discount:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
UPDATE Customer c
SET c.discount = 
    CASE c.level
        WHEN 'Gold' THEN 20
        WHEN 'SILVER' THEN 15
        WHEN 'Bronze' THEN 10
        ELSE 5
    END
----

[[BNBVR]]

[[null-values]]
39.6.5.14 NULL Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the target of a reference is not in the persistent store, the target
is `NULL`. For conditional expressions containing `NULL`, the query
language uses the semantics defined by SQL92. Briefly, these semantics
are as follows.

* If a comparison or arithmetic operation has an unknown value, it
yields a `NULL` value.
* Two `NULL` values are not equal. Comparing two `NULL` values yields an
unknown value.
* The `IS NULL` test converts a `NULL` persistent field or a
single-valued relationship field to `TRUE`. The `IS NOT NULL` test
converts them to `FALSE`.
* Boolean operators and conditional tests use the three-valued logic
defined by link:#BNBVS[Table 39-7] and link:#BNBVT[Table 39-8]. (In
these tables, T stands for `TRUE`, F for `FALSE`, and U for unknown.)

[[equality-semantics]]
39.6.5.15 Equality Semantics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the query language, only values of the same type can be compared.
However, this rule has one exception: Exact and approximate numeric
values can be compared. In such a comparison, the required type
conversion adheres to the rules of Java numeric promotion.

The query language treats compared values as if they were Java types and
not as if they represented types in the underlying data store. For
example, a persistent field that could be either an integer or a `NULL`
must be designated as an `Integer` object and not as an `int` primitive.
This designation is required because a Java object can be `NULL`, but a
primitive cannot.

Two strings are equal only if they contain the same sequence of
characters. Trailing blanks are significant; for example, the strings
`'abc'` and `'abc '` are not equal.

Two entities of the same abstract schema type are equal only if their
primary keys have the same value. link:#BNBVV[Table 39-9] shows the
operator logic of a negation, and link:#BNBVW[Table 39-10] shows the
truth values of conditional tests.

[[select-clause]]
39.6.6 SELECT Clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `SELECT` clause defines the types of the objects or values returned
by the query.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#BNBVY[Section 39.6.6.1, "Return Types"]
* link:#BNBWB[Section 39.6.6.2, "The DISTINCT Keyword"]
* link:#BNBWC[Section 39.6.6.3, "Constructor Expressions"]

[[BNBVY]]

[[return-types]]
39.6.6.1 Return Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The return type of the `SELECT` clause is defined by the result types of
the select expressions contained within it. If multiple expressions are
used, the result of the query is an `Object[]`, and the elements in the
array correspond to the order of the expressions in the `SELECT` clause
and in type to the result types of each expression.

A `SELECT` clause cannot specify a collection-valued expression. For
example, the `SELECT` clause `p.teams` is invalid because `teams` is a
collection. However, the clause in the following query is valid because
`t` is a single element of the `teams` collection:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT t
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) t
----

The following query is an example of a query with multiple expressions
in the `SELECT` clause:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c.name, c.country.name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Coss' AND c.firstname = 'Roxane'
----

This query returns a list of `Object[]` elements; the first array
element is a string denoting the customer name, and the second array
element is a string denoting the name of the customer's country.

The result of a query may be the result of an aggregate function, listed
in link:#BNBWA[Table 39-11].

[[sthref177]][[BNBWA]]

Table 39-11 Aggregate Functions in Select Statements

[width="57%",cols="36%,,64%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Return Type |Description
|`AVG` |`Double` |Returns the mean average of the fields

|`COUNT` |`Long` |Returns the total number of results

|`MAX` |The type of the field |Returns the highest value in the result
set

|`MIN` |The type of the field |Returns the lowest value in the result
set

|`SUM` a|
`Long` (for integral fields)

`Double` (for floating-point fields)

`BigInteger` (for `BigInteger` fields)

`BigDecimal` (for `BigDecimal` fields)

 |Returns the sum of all the values in the result set
|=======================================================================


For select method queries with an aggregate function (`AVG`, `COUNT`,
`MAX`, `MIN`, or `SUM`) in the `SELECT` clause, the following rules
apply.

* The `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `SUM` functions return `null` if there
are no values to which the function can be applied.
* The `COUNT` function returns 0 if there are no values to which the
function can be applied.

The following example returns the average order quantity:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT AVG(o.quantity)
FROM CustomerOrder o
----

The following example returns the total cost of the items ordered by
Roxane Coss:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT SUM(l.price)
FROM CustomerOrder o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Coss' AND c.firstname = 'Roxane'
----

The following example returns the total number of orders:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT COUNT(o)
FROM CustomerOrder o
----

The following example returns the total number of items that have prices
in Hal Incandenza's order:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT COUNT(l.price)
FROM CustomerOrder o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Incandenza' AND c.firstname = 'Hal'
----

[[BNBWB]]

[[the-distinct-keyword]]
39.6.6.2 The DISTINCT Keyword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `DISTINCT` keyword eliminates duplicate return values. If a query
returns a `java.util.Collection`, which allows duplicates, you must
specify the `DISTINCT` keyword to eliminate duplicates.

[[BNBWC]]

[[constructor-expressions]]
39.6.6.3 Constructor Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Constructor expressions allow you to return Java instances that store a
query result element instead of an `Object[]`.

The following query creates a `CustomerDetail` instance per `Customer`
matching the `WHERE` clause. A `CustomerDetail` stores the customer name
and customer's country name. So the query returns a `List` of
`CustomerDetail` instances:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT NEW com.example.CustomerDetail(c.name, c.country.name)
FROM customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Coss' AND c.firstname = 'Roxane'
----

[[BNBWD]]

[[order-by-clause]]
39.6.7 ORDER BY Clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As its name suggests, the `ORDER BY` clause orders the values or objects
returned by the query.

If the `ORDER BY` clause contains multiple elements, the left-to-right
sequence of the elements determines the high-to-low precedence.

The `ASC` keyword specifies ascending order, the default, and the `DESC`
keyword indicates descending order.

When using the `ORDER BY` clause, the `SELECT` clause must return an
orderable set of objects or values. You cannot order the values or
objects for values or objects not returned by the `SELECT` clause. For
example, the following query is valid because the `ORDER BY` clause uses
the objects returned by the `SELECT` clause:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT o
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o JOIN c.address a
WHERE a.state = 'CA'
ORDER BY o.quantity, o.totalcost
----

The following example is not valid, because the `ORDER BY` clause uses a
value not returned by the `SELECT` clause:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT p.product_name
FROM CustomerOrder o, IN(o.lineItems) l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Faehmel' AND c.firstname = 'Robert'
ORDER BY o.quantity
----

[[BNBWE]]

[[group-by-and-having-clauses]]
39.6.8 GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `GROUP BY` clause allows you to group values according to a set of
properties.

The following query groups the customers by their country and returns
the number of customers per country:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c.country, COUNT(c)
FROM Customer c GROUP BY c.country
----

The `HAVING` clause is used with the `GROUP BY` clause to further
restrict the returned result of a query.

The following query groups orders by the status of their customer and
returns the customer status plus the average `totalPrice` for all orders
where the corresponding customers have the same status. In addition, it
considers only customers with status `1`, `2`, or `3`, so orders of
other customers are not taken into account:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SELECT c.status, AVG(o.totalPrice)
FROM CustomerOrder o JOIN o.customer c
GROUP BY c.status HAVING c.status IN (1, 2, 3)
----
