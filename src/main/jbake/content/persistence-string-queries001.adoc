41.1 Overview of String-Based Criteria API Queries
--------------------------------------------------

String-based Criteria API queries ("string-based queries") are Java
programming language queries that use strings rather than strongly typed
metamodel objects to specify entity attributes when traversing a data
hierarchy. String-based queries are constructed similarly to metamodel
queries, can be static or dynamic, and can express the same kind of
queries and operations as strongly typed metamodel queries.

Strongly typed metamodel queries are the preferred method of
constructing Criteria API queries.

The main advantage of string-based queries over metamodel queries is the
ability to construct Criteria queries at development time without the
need to generate static metamodel classes or otherwise access
dynamically generated metamodel classes.

The main disadvantage to string-based queries is their lack of type
safety; this problem may lead to runtime errors due to type mismatches
that would be caught at development time if you used strongly typed
metamodel queries.

For information on constructing criteria queries, see
link:persistence-criteria.html#GJITV[Chapter 40, "Using the Criteria API
to Create Queries"].
