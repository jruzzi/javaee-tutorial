3 Resource Creation
-------------------


A resource is a program object that provides connections to such systems
as database servers and messaging systems. Java EE components can access
a wide variety of resources, including databases, mail sessions, Java
Message Service objects, and URLs. The Java EE 7 platform provides
mechanisms that allow you to access all these resources in a similar
manner. This chapter examines several types of resources and explains
how to create them.

The following topics are addressed here:
