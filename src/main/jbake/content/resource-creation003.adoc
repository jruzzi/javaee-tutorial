3.3 Creating Resources Administratively
---------------------------------------

Before you deploy or run many applications, you may need to create
resources for them. An application can include a
`glassfish-resources.xml` file that can be used to define resources for
that application and others. You can then use the `asadmin` command,
specifying as the argument a file named `glassfish-resources.xml`, to
create the resources administratively, as shown.

----
asadmin add-resources glassfish-resources.xml
----

The `glassfish-resources.xml` file can be created in any project using
NetBeans IDE or by hand. Some of the JMS examples use this approach to
resource creation. A file for creating the resources needed for the JMS
simple producer example can be found in the
`jms/simple/producer/src/main/setup` directory.

You could also use the `asadmin create-jms-resource` command to create
the resources for this example. When you are done using the resources,
you would use the `asadmin list-jms-resources` command to display their
names, and the `asadmin delete-jms-resource` command to remove them,
regardless of the way you created the resources.
