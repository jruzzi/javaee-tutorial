52.2 Metadata Annotations
-------------------------

Java EE Connector Architecture provides a set of annotations to minimize
the need for deployment descriptors.

* The `@Connector` annotation can be used by the resource adapter
developer to specify that the JavaBeans component is a resource adapter
JavaBeans component. This annotation is used for providing metadata
about the capabilities of the resource adapter. Optionally, you can
provide a JavaBeans component implementing the `ResourceAdapter`
interface, as in the following example:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Connector(
    displayName = "TrafficResourceAdapter",
    vendorName = "Java EE Tutorial", 
    version = "7.0"
)
public class TrafficResourceAdapter implements ResourceAdapter, 
                                               Serializable {
    ...
}
----
* The `@ConnectionDefinition` annotation defines a set of connection
interfaces and classes pertaining to a particular connection type, as in
the following example:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@ConnectionDefinition(
    connectionFactory = ConnectionFactory.class,
    connectionFactoryImpl = TradeConnectionFactory.class,
    connection = Connection.class,
    connectionImpl = TradeConnection.class
)
public class TradeManagedConnectionFactory ... {
    ...
}
----
* The `@AdministeredObject` annotation designates a JavaBeans component
as an administered object.
* The `@Activation` annotation contains configuration information
pertaining to inbound connectivity from an EIS instance, as in the
following example:
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
@Activation(
        messageListeners = { TrafficListener.class }
)
public class TrafficActivationSpec implements ActivationSpec, 
                                              Serializable {
    ...
    @ConfigProperty()
    /* port to listen to requests from the EIS */
    private String port;
    ...
}
----
* The `@ConfigProperty` annotation can be used on JavaBeans components
to provide additional configuration information that may be used by the
deployer and resource adapter provider. The preceding example code shows
several `@ConfigProperty` annotations.
* The `@ConnectionFactoryDefinition` annotation is a resource definition
annotation that is used to define a connector connection factory and
register it in JNDI under the name specified in the mandatory `name`
annotation element. The mandatory `interfaceName` annotation element
specifies the fully qualified name of the connection factory interface
class. The `transactionSupport` annotation element specifies the level
of transaction support the connection factory needs to support. The
`minPoolSize` and `maxPoolSize` annotation elements specify the minimum
or maximum number of connections that should be allocated for a
connection pool that backs this connection factory resource. Additional
properties associated with the connection factory being defined can be
specified through the `properties` element.
+
Since repeated annotations are not allowed, the
`@ConnectionFactoryDefinitions` annotation acts as a container for
multiple connector connection factory definitions. The `value`
annotation element contains the multiple connector connection factory
definitions.
* The `@AdministeredObjectDefinition` annotation is a resource
definition annotation that is used to define an administered object and
register it in JNDI under the name specified in the mandatory `name`
annotation element. The mandatory fully qualified name of the
administered object's class must be indicated by the `className`
element. Additional properties that must be configured in the
administered object can be specified through the `properties` element.
+
Since repeated annotations are not allowed, the
`@AdministeredObjectDefinitions` annotation acts as a container for
multiple administered object definitions. The `value` annotation element
contains the multiple administered object definitions.

The specification allows a resource adapter to be developed in
mixed-mode form, that is the ability for a resource adapter developer to
use both metadata annotations and deployment descriptors in
applications. An application assembler or deployer may use the
deployment descriptor to override the metadata annotations specified by
the resource adapter developer.

The deployment descriptor for a resource adapter, if present, is named
`ra.xml`. The `metadata-complete` attribute defines whether the
deployment descriptor for the resource adapter module is complete or
whether the class files available to the module and packaged with the
resource adapter need to be examined for annotations that specify
deployment information.

For the complete list of annotations and JavaBeans components provided
in the Java EE 7 platform, see the Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7
specification.
