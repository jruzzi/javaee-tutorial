52.3 Common Client Interface
----------------------------

This section explains how components use the Connector Architecture
Common Client Interface (CCI) API and a resource adapter to access data
from an EIS. The CCI API defines a set of interfaces and classes whose
methods allow a client to perform typical data access operations. The
CCI interfaces and classes are as follows.

* `ConnectionFactory`: Provides an application component with a
`Connection` instance to an EIS.
* `Connection`: Represents the connection to the underlying EIS.
* `ConnectionSpec`: Provides a means for an application component to
pass connection-request-specific properties to the `ConnectionFactory`
when making a connection request.
* `Interaction`: Provides a means for an application component to
execute EIS functions, such as database stored procedures.
* `InteractionSpec`: Holds properties pertaining to an application
component's interaction with an EIS.
* `Record`: The superinterface for the various kinds of record
instances. Record instances can be `MappedRecord`, `IndexedRecord`, or
`ResultSet` instances, all of which inherit from the `Record` interface.
* `RecordFactory`: Provides an application component with a `Record`
instance.
* `IndexedRecord`: Represents an ordered collection of `Record`
instances based on the `java.util.List` interface.

A client or application component that uses the CCI to interact with an
underlying EIS does so in a prescribed manner. The component must
establish a connection to the EIS's resource manager, and it does so
using the `ConnectionFactory`. The `Connection` object represents the
connection to the EIS and is used for subsequent interactions with the
EIS.

The component performs its interactions with the EIS, such as accessing
data from a specific table, using an `Interaction` object. The
application component defines the Interaction object by using an
`InteractionSpec` object. When it reads data from the EIS, such as from
database tables, or writes to those tables, the application component
does so by using a particular type of `Record` instance: a
`MappedRecord`, an `IndexedRecord`, or a `ResultSet` instance.

Note, too, that a client application that relies on a CCI resource
adapter is very much like any other Java EE client that uses enterprise
bean methods.
