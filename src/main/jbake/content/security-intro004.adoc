47.4 Securing GlassFish Server
------------------------------

This tutorial describes deployment to GlassFish Server, which provides
highly secure, interoperable, and distributed component computing based
on the Java EE security model. GlassFish Server supports the Java EE 7
security model. You can configure GlassFish Server for the following
purposes.

* Adding, deleting, or modifying authorized users. For more information
on this topic, see link:security-intro005.html#BNBXJ[Working with Realms,
Users, Groups, and Roles].
* Configuring secure HTTP and Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP)
listeners.
* Configuring secure Java Management Extensions (JMX) connectors.
* Adding, deleting, or modifying existing or custom realms.
* Defining an interface for pluggable authorization providers using Java
Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC). JACC defines security
contracts between GlassFish Server and authorization policy modules.
These contracts specify how the authorization providers are installed,
configured, and used in access decisions.
* Using pluggable audit modules.
* Customizing authentication mechanisms. All implementations of Java EE
7 compatible web containers are required to support the Servlet Profile
of JSR 196, which offers an avenue for customizing the authentication
mechanism applied by the web container on behalf of one or more
applications.
* Setting and changing policy permissions for an application.
