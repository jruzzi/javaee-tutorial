49.1 Basic Security Tasks for Enterprise Applications
-----------------------------------------------------

System administrators, application developers, bean providers, and
deployers are responsible for administering security for enterprise
applications. The basic security tasks are as follows:

* Setting up a database of users and assigning them to the proper group
* Setting up identity propagation
* Setting GlassFish Server properties that enable the applications to
run properly, such as setting default principal-to-role mapping
* Annotating the classes and methods of an enterprise application to
provide information about which methods need to have restricted access

The sections on the security examples in this chapter and the previous
chapter explain how to perform these tasks.
