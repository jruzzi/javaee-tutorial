17.1 What Is a Servlet?
-----------------------

A servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the
capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a
request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any
type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications
hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology
defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.

The `javax.servlet` and `javax.servlet.http` packages provide interfaces
and classes for writing servlets. All servlets must implement the
`Servlet` interface, which defines lifecycle methods. When implementing
a generic service, you can use or extend the `GenericServlet` class
provided with the Java Servlet API. The `HttpServlet` class provides
methods, such as `doGet` and `doPost`, for handling HTTP-specific
services.
