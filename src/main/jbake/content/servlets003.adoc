17.3 Sharing Information
------------------------

Web components, like most objects, usually work with other objects to
accomplish their tasks. Web components can do so by doing the following.

* Using private helper objects (for example, JavaBeans components).
* Sharing objects that are attributes of a public scope.
* Using a database.
* Invoking other web resources. The Java Servlet technology mechanisms
that allow a web component to invoke other web resources are described
in link:servlets007.html#BNAGI[Invoking Other Web Resources].

17.3.1 Using Scope Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collaborating web components share information by means of objects that
are maintained as attributes of four scope objects. You access these
attributes by using the `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` methods of the
class representing the scope. link:#BNAFQ[Table 17-2] lists the scope
objects.

17.3.2 Controlling Concurrent Access to Shared Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a multithreaded server, shared resources can be accessed
concurrently. In addition to scope object attributes, shared resources
include in-memory data, such as instance or class variables, and
external objects, such as files, database connections, and network
connections.

Concurrent access can arise in several situations.

* Multiple web components accessing objects stored in the web context.
* Multiple web components accessing objects stored in a session.
* Multiple threads within a web component accessing instance variables.
A web container will typically create a thread to handle each request.
To ensure that a servlet instance handles only one request at a time, a
servlet can implement the `SingleThreadModel` interface. If a servlet
implements this interface, no two threads will execute concurrently in
the servlet's service method. A web container can implement this
guarantee by synchronizing access to a single instance of the servlet or
by maintaining a pool of web component instances and dispatching each
new request to a free instance. This interface does not prevent
synchronization problems that result from web components' accessing
shared resources, such as static class variables or external objects.

When resources can be accessed concurrently, they can be used in an
inconsistent fashion. You prevent this by controlling the access using
the synchronization techniques described in the Threads lesson at
`http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/`.
