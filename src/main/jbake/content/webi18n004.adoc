20.4 Character Sets and Encodings
---------------------------------

The following sections describe character sets and character encodings.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#BNAYC[Section 20.4.1, "Character Sets"]
* link:#BNAYD[Section 20.4.2, "Character Encoding"]

[[character-sets]]
20.4.1 Character Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A character set is a set of textual and graphic symbols, each of which
is mapped to a set of nonnegative integers.

The first character set used in computing was US-ASCII. It is limited in
that it can represent only American English. US-ASCII contains uppercase
and lowercase Latin alphabets, numerals, punctuation, a set of control
codes, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Unicode defines a standardized, universal character set that can be
extended to accommodate additions. When the Java program source file
encoding doesn't support Unicode, you can represent Unicode characters
as escape sequences by using the notation `\u`XXXX, where XXXX is the
character's 16-bit representation in hexadecimal. For example, the
Spanish version of a message file could use Unicode for non-ASCII
characters, as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
admin.nav.main=P\u00e1gina principal de administraci\u00f3n
----

[[character-encoding]]
20.4.2 Character Encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A character encoding maps a character set to units of a specific width
and defines byte serialization and ordering rules. Many character sets
have more than one encoding. For example, Java programs can represent
Japanese character sets using the `EUC-JP` or `Shift-JIS` encodings,
among others. Each encoding has rules for representing and serializing a
character set.

The ISO 8859 series defines 13 character encodings that can represent
texts in dozens of languages. Each ISO 8859 character encoding can have
up to 256 characters. ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) comprises the ASCII character
set, characters with diacritics (accents, diaereses, cedillas,
circumflexes, and so on), and additional symbols.

UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit form) is a variable-width
character encoding that encodes 16-bit Unicode characters as one to four
bytes. A byte in UTF-8 is equivalent to 7-bit ASCII if its high-order
bit is zero; otherwise, the character comprises a variable number of
bytes.

UTF-8 is compatible with the majority of existing web content and
provides access to the Unicode character set. Current versions of
browsers and email clients support UTF-8. In addition, many web
standards specify UTF-8 as their character encoding. For example, UTF-8
is one of the two required encodings for XML documents (the other is
UTF-16).

Web components usually use `PrintWriter` to produce responses;
`PrintWriter` automatically encodes using ISO-8859-1. Servlets can also
output binary data using `OutputStream` classes, which perform no
encoding. An application that uses a character set that cannot use the
default encoding must explicitly set a different encoding.
